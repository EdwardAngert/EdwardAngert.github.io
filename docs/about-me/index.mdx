## Hire Me

I find ways to make things work better and love empowering people to accomplish their goals. I do that with collaboration, technology, by meeting people where they are, and by anticipating their needs with empathy.

Part of my resume is available on this site on the [resume page](about-me/resume), and the rest of this site has documentation I've put together for fun, like how I [implement Pi-hole at home](docs/pi-hole).
