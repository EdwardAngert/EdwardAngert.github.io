## Hire Me

I find ways to make things work better and love empowering people to accomplish their goals. I do that with communication, tools, and technology, by meeting people where they are and anticipating their needs with empathy.

Part of my resume is available on this site on the [resume page](about-me/resume), and the rest of this site has documentation I've put together for fun, like how I [implement Pi-hole at home](docs/pi-hole).

Connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-angert/) or set up a time to talk through [my cal.com link](https://cal.com/edwardangert).
